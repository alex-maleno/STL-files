# STL-files
This contains all the STL files that I created for various personal projects.

arduino-case.stl & arduino-case-top.stl: Used in my Audio Visualizer project to contain the
                                         Arduino Uno and the Sparkfun Spectrum Shield, see my
                                         LED-Audio-Visualizer repo for more details.

Pencil-Holder.stl & blank_pannel.stl: I made a custom pencil holder for my desk, along with 
                                      inserts to add interchangable designs on the different 
                                      sides of the pencil holder. blank-pannel.stl is a template
                                      for anyone else who would want to print out the pencil 
                                      holder and make their own designs, as it is the correct size
                                      to slide in the slots within the holder.

Mom_plague.stl: This was a Mother's Day gift from me to my mom, calling here the "CEO" of my house
                to show her how much I appreciate her for everything she does for our family.

marker-holder.stl: Many of my housemates at school have whiteboards in their rooms, and they asked 
                   me to design a holder for their dry erase markers and eraser.
                   
hooks.stl: I made these simple hooks / pegs to hold the tools I use to pry 3D prints off the 
           printer bed.
           
darksaber-stand.stl: I am a pretty big Star Wars fan, and I wanted to print out a lightsaber hilt
                     that I found online, so I designed this stand to match the aesthetic of the
                     hilt and allow me to display the hilt on top of my desk at school.
